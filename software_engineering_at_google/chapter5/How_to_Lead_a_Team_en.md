# Chapter 5 **How to Lead a Team**

​	We’ve covered a lot of ground so far on the culture and composition of teams writing
software, and in this chapter, we’ll take a look at the person ultimately responsible for
making it all work.
​	No team can function well without a leader, especially at Google, where engineering
is almost exclusively a team endeavor. At Google, we recognize two different leader‐
ship roles. A Manager is a leader of people, whereas a Tech Lead leads technology
efforts. Although the responsibilities of these two roles require similar planning skills,
they require quite different people skills.
​	A boat without a captain is nothing more than a floating waiting room: unless some‐
one grabs the rudder and starts the engine, it’s just going to drift along aimlessly with
the current. A piece of software is just like that boat: if no one pilots it, you’re left with
a group of engineers burning up valuable time, just sitting around waiting for some‐
thing to happen (or worse, still writing code that you don’t need). Although this chap‐
ter is about people management and technical leadership, it is still worth a read if
you’re an individual contributor because it will likely help you understand your own
leaders a bit better.



## **Managers and Tech Leads (and Both)**

​	Whereas every engineering team generally has a leader, they acquire those leaders in

different ways. This is certainly true at Google; sometimes an experienced manager

comes in to run a team, and sometimes an individual contributor is promoted into a

leadership position (usually of a smaller team).

In nascent teams, both roles will sometimes be filled by the same person: a *Tech Lead*

*Manager* (TLM). On larger teams, an experienced people manager will step in to take

on the management role while a senior engineer with extensive experience will step

into the tech lead role. Even though manager and tech lead each play an important

part in the growth and productivity of an engineering team, the people skills required

to succeed in each role are wildly different.



## **The Engineering Manager**

​	Many companies bring in trained people managers who might know little to nothing

about software engineering to run their engineering teams. Google decided early on,

however, that its software engineering managers should have an engineering back‐

ground. This meant hiring experienced managers who used to be software engineers,

or training software engineers to be managers (more on this later).

At the highest level, an engineering manager is responsible for the performance, pro‐

ductivity, and happiness of every person on their team—including their tech lead—

while still making sure that the needs of the business are met by the product for

which they are responsible. Because the needs of the business and the needs of indi‐

vidual team members don’t always align, this can often place a manager in a difficult

position.



## **The Tech Lead**

​	The tech lead (TL) of a team—who will often report to the manager of that team—is

responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology

decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project manage‐

ment (although on larger teams they might have program managers helping out with

this). The TL will usually work hand in hand with the engineering manager to ensure

that the team is adequately staffed for their product and that engineers are set to work

on tasks that best match their skill sets and skill levels. Most TLs are also individual

contributors, which often forces them to choose between doing something quickly

themselves or delegating it to a team member to do (sometimes) more slowly. The

latter is most often the correct decision for the TL as they grow the size and capability

of their team.



## **The Tech Lead Manager**

​	On small and nascent teams for which engineering managers need a strong technical

skill set, the default is often to have a TLM: a single person who can handle both the

people and technical needs of their team. Sometimes, a TLM is a more senior person,

but more often than not, the role is taken on by someone who was, until recently, an

individual contributor.

​	At Google, it’s customary for larger, well-established teams to have a pair of leaders—

one TL and one engineering manager—working together as partners. The theory is

that it’s really difficult to do both jobs at the same time (well) without completely

burning out, so it’s better to have two specialists crushing each role with dedicated

focus.

​	The job of TLM is a tricky one and often requires the TLM to learn how to balance

individual work, delegation, and people management. As such, it usually requires a

high degree of mentoring and assistance from more experienced TLMs. (In fact, we

recommend that in addition to taking a number of classes that Google offers on this

subject, a newly minted TLM seek out a senior mentor who can advise them regularly

as they grow into the role.)



## **Case Study: Influencing Without Authority**

​	It’s generally accepted that you can get folks who report to you to do the work that

you need done for your products, but it’s different when you need to get people out‐

side of your organization—or heck, even outside of your product area sometimes—to

do something that you think needs to be done. This “influence without authority” is

one of the most powerful leadership traits that you can develop.

​	For example, for years, Jeff Dean, senior engineering fellow and possibly the most

well-known Googler *inside* of Google, led only a fraction of Google’s engineering

team, but his influence on technical decisions and direction reaches to the ends of the

entire engineering organization and beyond (thanks to his writing and speaking out‐

side of the company).

​	Another example is a team that I started called The Data Liberation Front: with a

team of less than a half-dozen engineers, we managed to get more than 50 Google

products to export their data through a product that we launched called Google Take‐

out. At the time, there was no formal directive from the executive level at Google for

all products to be a part of Takeout, so how did we get hundreds of engineers to con‐

tribute to this effort? By identifying a strategic need for the company, showing how it

linked to the mission and existing priorities of the company, and working with a

small group of engineers to develop a tool that allowed teams to quickly and easily

integrate with Takeout.



## **Moving from an Individual Contributor Role to a Leadership Role**

​	Whether or not they’re officially appointed, someone needs to get into the driver’s

seat if your product is ever going to go anywhere, and if you’re the motivated, impa‐

tient type, that person might be you. You might find yourself sucked into helping

your team resolve conflicts, make decisions, and coordinate people. It happens all the

time, and often by accident. Maybe you never intended to become a “leader,” but

somehow it happened anyway. Some people refer to this affliction as “manageritis.”

​	Even if you’ve sworn to yourself that you’ll never become a manager, at some point in

your career, you’re likely to find yourself in a leadership position, especially if you’ve

been successful in your role. The rest of this chapter is intended to help you under‐

stand what to do when this happens.

​	We’re not here to attempt to convince you to become a manager, but rather to help

show why the best leaders work to serve their team using the principles of humility,

respect, and trust. Understanding the ins and outs of leadership is a vital skill for

influencing the direction of your work. If you want to steer the boat for your project

and not just go along for the ride, you need to know how to navigate, or you’ll run

yourself (and your project) onto a sandbar.



## **The Only Thing to Fear Is…Well, Everything**

​	Aside from the general sense of malaise that most people feel when they hear the

word “manager,” there are a number of reasons that most people don’t want to

become managers. The biggest reason you’ll hear in the software development world

is that you spend much less time writing code. This is true whether you become a TL

or an engineering manager, and I’ll talk more about this later in the chapter, but first,

let’s cover some more reasons why most of us avoid becoming managers.

​	If you’ve spent the majority of your career writing code, you typically end a day with

something you can point to—whether it’s code, a design document, or a pile of bugs

you just closed—and say, “That’s what I did today.” But at the end of a busy day of

“management,” you’ll usually find yourself thinking, “I didn’t do a damned thing

today.” It’s the equivalent of spending years counting the number of apples you picked

each day and changing to a job growing bananas, only to say to yourself at the end of

each day, “I didn’t pick any apples,” happily ignoring the flourishing banana trees sit‐

ting next to you. Quantifying management work is more difficult than counting

widgets you turned out, but just making it possible for your team to be happy and

productive is a big measure of your job. Just don’t fall into the trap of counting apples

when you’re growing bananas.1

​	Another big reason for not becoming a manager is often unspoken but rooted in the

famous “Peter Principle,” which states that “In a hierarchy every employee tends to

rise to his level of incompetence.” Google generally avoids this by requiring that a

person perform the job *above* their current level for a period of time (i.e., to “exceedsexpectations” at their current level)

before being promoted to that level. Most people

have had a manager who was incapable of doing their job or was just really bad at

managing people,2 and we know some people who have worked only for bad manag‐

ers. If you’ve been exposed only to crappy managers for your entire career, why would

you *ever* want to be a manager? Why would you want to be promoted to a role that

you don’t feel able to do?

​	There are, however, great reasons to consider becoming a TL or manager. First, it’s a

way to scale yourself. Even if you’re great at writing code, there’s still an upper limit to

the amount of code you can write. Imagine how much code a team of great engineers

could write under your leadership! Second, you might just be really good at it—many

people who find themselves sucked into the leadership vacuum of a project discover

that they’re exceptionally skilled at providing the kind of guidance, help, and air cover

a team or a company needs. Someone has to lead, so why not you?



## **Servant Leadership**

​	There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes managers in which they forget about

all the awful things their managers did to them and suddenly begin doing these same

things to “manage” the people that report to them. The symptoms of this disease

include, but are by no means limited to, micromanaging, ignoring low performers,

and hiring pushovers. Without prompt treatment, this disease can kill an entire team.

The best advice I received when I first became a manager at Google was from Steve

Vinter, an engineering director at the time. He said, “Above all, resist the urge to man‐

age.” One of the greatest urges of the newly minted manager is to actively “manage”

their employees because that’s what a manager does, right? This typically has disas‐

trous consequences.

​	The cure for the “management” disease is a liberal application of “servant leadership,”

which is a nice way of saying the most important thing you can do as a leader is to

serve your team, much like a butler or majordomo tends to the health and well-being

of a household. As a servant leader, you should strive to create an atmosphere of

humility, respect, and trust. This might mean removing bureaucratic obstacles that a

team member can’t remove by themselves, helping a team achieve consensus, or even

buying dinner for the team when they’re working late at the office. The servant leader

fills in the cracks to smooth the way for their team and advises them when necessary,

but still isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty. The only managing that a servant

leader does is to manage both the technical and social health of the team; as tempting 

as it might be to focus on purely the technical health of the team, the social health of

the team is just as important (but often infinitely more difficult to manage).



## **The Engineering Manager**

​	So, what is actually expected of a manager at a modern software company? Before the

computing age, “management” and “labor” might have taken on almost antagonistic

roles, with the manager wielding all of the power and labor requiring collective action

to achieve its own ends. But that isn’t how modern software companies work.



## **Manager Is a Four-Letter Word**

​	Before talking about the core responsibilities of an engineering manager at Google,

let’s review the history of managers. The present-day concept of the pointy-haired

manager is partially a carryover, first from military hierarchy and later adopted by the

Industrial Revolution—more than a hundred years ago! Factories began popping up

everywhere, and they required (usually unskilled) workers to keep the machines

going. Consequently, these workers required supervisors to manage them, and

because it was easy to replace these workers with other people who were desperate for

a job, the managers had little motivation to treat their employees well or improve

conditions for them. Whether humane or not, this method worked well for many

years when the employees had nothing more to do than perform rote tasks.

​	Managers frequently treated employees in the same way that cart drivers would treat

their mules: they motivated them by alternately leading them forward with a carrot,

and, when that didn’t work, whipping them with a stick. This carrot-and-stick

method of management survived the transition from the factory3 to the modern

office, where the stereotype of the tough-as-nails manager-as-mule-driver flourished

in the middle part of the twentieth century when employees would work at the same

job for years and years.

​	This continues today in some industries—even in industries that require creative

thinking and problem solving—despite numerous studies suggesting that the anach‐

ronistic carrot and stick is ineffective and harmful to the productivity of creative peo‐

ple. Whereas the assembly-line worker of years past could be trained in days and

replaced at will, software engineers working on large codebases can take months to

get up to speed on a new team. Unlike the replaceable assembly-line worker, these

people need nurturing, time, and space to think and create.



## **Today’s Engineering Manager**

​	Most people still use the title “manager” despite the fact that it’s often an anachron‐

ism. The title itself often encourages new managers to *manage* their reports. Manag‐

ers can wind up acting like parents,4 and consequently employees react like children.

To frame this in the context of humility, respect, and trust: if a manager makes it

obvious that they trust their employee, the employee feels positive pressure to live up

to that trust. It’s that simple. A good manager forges the way for a team, looking out

for their safety and well-being, all while making sure their needs are met. If there’s

one thing you remember from this chapter, make it this:

Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers

worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).

A new engineer, Jerry, joined my team a few years ago. Jerry’s last manager (at a dif‐

ferent company) was adamant that he be at his desk from 9:00 to 5:00 every day, and

assumed that if he wasn’t there, he wasn’t working enough (which is, of course, a

ridiculous assumption). On his first day working with me, Jerry came to me at 4:40

p.m. and stammered out an apology that he had to leave 15 minutes early because he

had an appointment that he had been unable to reschedule. I looked at him, smiled,

and told him flat out, “Look, as long as you get your job done, I don’t care what time

you leave the office.” Jerry stared blankly at me for a few seconds, nodded, and went

on his way. I treated Jerry like an adult; he always got his work done, and I never had

to worry about him being at his desk, because he didn’t need a babysitter to get his

work done. If your employees are so uninterested in their job that they actually need

traditional-manager babysitting to be convinced to work, *that* is your real problem.



## **Failure Is an Option**

​	Another way to catalyze your team is to make them feel safe and secure so that they

can take greater risks by building psychological safety—meaning that your team

members feel like they can be themselves without fear of negative repercussions from

you or their team members. Risk is a fascinating thing; most humans are terrible at

evaluating risk, and most companies try to avoid risk at all costs. As a result, the usual

modus operandi is to work conservatively and focus on smaller successes, even when

taking a bigger risk might mean exponentially greater success. A common saying at

Google is that if you try to achieve an impossible goal, there’s a good chance you’ll

fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you’ll most likely accomplish far

more than you would have accomplished had you merely attempted something you

knew you could complete. A good way to build a culture in which risk taking is

accepted is to let your team know that it’s OK to fail.

​	So, let’s get that out of the way: it’s OK to fail. In fact, we like to think of failure as a

way of learning a lot really quickly (provided that you’re not repeatedly failing at the

same thing). In addition, it’s important to see failure as an opportunity to learn and

not to point fingers or assign blame. Failing fast is good because there’s not a lot at

stake. Failing slowly can also teach a valuable lesson, but it is more painful because

more is at risk and more can be lost (usually engineering time). Failing in a manner

that affects customers is probably the least desirable failure that we encounter, but it’s

also one in which we have the greatest amount of structure in place to learn from fail‐

ures. As mentioned earlier, every time there is a major production failure at Google,

we perform a postmortem. This procedure is a way to document the events that led to

the actual failure and to develop a series of steps that will prevent it from happening

in the future. This is neither an opportunity to point fingers, nor is it intended to

introduce unnecessary bureaucratic checks; rather, the goal is to strongly focus on the

core of the problem and fix it once and for all. It’s very difficult, but quite effective

(and cathartic).

​	Individual successes and failures are a bit different. It’s one thing to laud individual

successes, but looking to assign individual blame in the case of failure is a great way to

divide a team and discourage risk taking across the board. It’s alright to fail, but fail as

a team and learn from your failures. If an individual succeeds, praise them in front of

the team. If an individual fails, give constructive criticism in private.5 Whatever the

case, take advantage of the opportunity and apply a liberal helping of humility,

respect, and trust to help your team learn from its failures.



## **Antipatterns**

Before we go over a litany of “design patterns” for successful TLs and engineering

managers, we’re going to review a collection of the patterns that you *don’t* want to fol‐

low if you want to be a successful manager. We’ve observed these destructive patterns

in a handful of bad managers that we’ve encountered in our careers, and in more than

a few cases, ourselves.
