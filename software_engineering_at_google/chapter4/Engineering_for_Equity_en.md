If you are an engineering manager working on hiring more people from underrepresented groups, deferring to the historical impact of discrimination in the world is a useful academic exercise. However, it is critical to move beyond the academic conversation to a focus on quantifiable and actionable steps that you can take to drive equity and fairness. For example, as a hiring software engineer manager, you’re accountable for ensuring that your candidate slates are balanced. Are there women or other underrepresented groups in the pool of candidates’ reviews? After you hire someone, what opportunities for growth have you provided, and is the distribution of opportunities equitable? Every technology lead or software engineering manager has the means to augment equity on their teams. It is important that we acknowledge that, although there are significant systemic challenges, we are all part of the system. It is our problem to fix. 

## Reject Singular Approaches 

We cannot perpetuate solutions that present a single philosophy or methodology for fixing inequity in the technology sector. Our problems are complex and multifactorial. Therefore, we must disrupt singular approaches to advancing representation in the workplace, even if they are promoted by people we admire or who have institutional power. 

One singular narrative held dear in the technology industry is that lack of representation in the workforce can be addressed solely by fixing the hiring pipelines. Yes, that is a fundamental step, but that is not the immediate issue we need to fix. We need to recognize systemic inequity in progression and retention while simultaneously focusing on more representative hiring and educational disparities across lines of race, gender, and socioeconomic and immigration status, for example.

In the technology industry, many people from underrepresented groups are passed over daily for opportunities and advancement. Attrition among Black+ Google employees outpaces attrition from all other groups and confounds progress on representation goals. If we want to drive change and increase representation, we need to evaluate whether we’re creating an ecosystem in which all aspiring engineers and other technology professionals can thrive. 

Fully understanding an entire problem space is critical to determining how to fix it. This holds true for everything from a critical data migration to the hiring of a representative workforce. For example, if you are an engineering manager who wants to hire more women, don’t just focus on building a pipeline. Focus on other aspects of the hiring, retention, and progression ecosystem and how inclusive it might or might not be to women. Consider whether your recruiters are demonstrating the ability to identify strong candidates who are women as well as men. If you manage a diverse engineering team, focus on psychological safety and invest in increasing multicultural capacity on the team so that new team members feel welcome.

A common methodology today is to build for the majority use case first, leaving improvements and features that address edge cases for later. But this approach is flawed; it gives users who are already advantaged in access to technology a head start, which increases inequity. Relegating the consideration of all user groups to the point when design has been nearly completed is to lower the bar of what it means to be an excellent engineer. Instead, by building in inclusive design from the start and raising development standards for development to make tools delightful and accessible for people who struggle to access technology, we enhance the experience for all users. 

Designing for the user who is least like you is not just wise, it’s a best practice. There are pragmatic and immediate next steps that all technologists, regardless of domain, should consider when developing products that avoid disadvantaging or underrepresenting users. It begins with more comprehensive user-experience research. This research should be done with user groups that are multilingual and multicultural and that span multiple countries, socioeconomic class, abilities, and age ranges. Focus on the most difficult or least represented use case first. 

## Challenge Established Processes 

Challenging yourself to build more equitable systems goes beyond designing more inclusive product specifications. Building equitable systems sometimes means challenging established processes that drive invalid results. 

Consider a recent case evaluated for equity implications. At Google, several engineering teams worked to build a global hiring requisition system. The system supports both external hiring and internal mobility. The engineers and product managers involved did a great job of listening to the requests of what they considered to be their core user group: recruiters. The recruiters were focused on minimizing wasted time for hiring managers and applicants, and they presented the development team with use cases focused on scale and efficiency for those people. To drive efficiency, the recruiters asked the engineering team to include a feature that would highlight performance ratings—specifically lower ratings—to the hiring manager and recruiter as soon as an internal transfer expressed interest in a job. 

On its face, expediting the evaluation process and helping jobseekers save time is a great goal. So where is the potential equity concern? The following equity questions were raised: 

​        • Are developmental assessments a predictive measure of performance?

​        • Are the performance assessments being presented to prospective managers free of individual bias?

​        • Are performance assessment scores standardized across organizations?



If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” presenting performance ratings could still drive inequitable, and therefore invalid, results. 

When an exceptional engineer questioned whether past performance was in fact predictive of future performance, the reviewing team decided to conduct a thorough review. In the end, it was determined that candidates who had received a poor performance rating were likely to overcome the poor rating if they found a new team. In fact, they were just as likely to receive a satisfactory or exemplary performance rating as candidates who had never received a poor rating. In short, performance ratings are indicative only of how a person is performing in their given role at the time they are being evaluated. Ratings, although an important way to measure performance during a specific period, are not predictive of future performance and should not be used to gauge readiness for a future role or qualify an internal candidate for a different team. (They can, however, be used to evaluate whether an employee is properly or improperly slotted on their current team; therefore, they can provide an opportunity to evaluate how to better support an internal candidate moving forward.) 

This analysis definitely took up significant project time, but the positive trade-off was a more equitable internal mobility process. 

## Values Versus Outcomes 

Google has a strong track record of investing in hiring. As the previous example illustrates, we also continually evaluate our processes in order to improve equity and inclusion. More broadly, our core values are based on respect and an unwavering commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. Yet, year after year, we have also missed our mark on hiring a representative workforce that reflects our users around the globe. The struggle to improve our equitable outcomes persists despite the policies and programs in place to help support inclusion initiatives and promote excellence in hiring and progression. The failure point is not in the values, intentions, or investments of the company, but rather in the application of those policies at the implementation level. 

Old habits are hard to break. The users you might be used to designing for today— the ones you are used to getting feedback from—might not be representative of all the users you need to reach. We see this play out frequently across all kinds of products, from wearables that do not work for women’s bodies to video-conferencing software that does not work well for people with darker skin tones. 

So, what’s the way out? 

1. Take a hard look in the mirror. At Google, we have the brand slogan, “Build For Everyone.” How can we build for everyone when we do not have a representative workforce or engagement model that centralizes community feedback first? We can’t. The truth is that we have at times very publicly failed to protect our most vulnerable users from racist, antisemitic, and homophobic content. 
2. Don’t build for everyone. Build with everyone. We are not building for every‐ one yet. That work does not happen in a vacuum, and it certainly doesn’t happen when the technology is still not representative of the population as a whole. That said, we can’t pack up and go home. So how do we build for everyone? We build with our users. We need to engage our users across the spectrum of humanity and be intentional about putting the most vulnerable communities at the center of our design. They should not be an afterthought. 
3. Design for the user who will have the most difficulty using your product. Building for those with additional challenges will make the product better for everyone. Another way of thinking about this is: don’t trade equity for short-term velocity.
4. Don’t assume equity; measure equity throughout your systems. Recognize that decision makers are also subject to bias and might be undereducated about the causes of inequity. You might not have the expertise to identify or measure the scope of an equity issue. Catering to a single userbase might mean disenfranchising another; these trade-offs can be difficult to spot and impossible to reverse. Partner with individuals or teams that are subject matter experts in diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
5. Change is possible. The problems we’re facing with technology today, from surveillance to disinformation to online harassment, are genuinely overwhelming. We can’t solve these with the failed approaches of the past or with just the skills we already have. We need to change.

## Stay Curious, Push Forward 

The path to equity is long and complex. However, we can and should transition from simply building tools and services to growing our understanding of how the products we engineer impact humanity. Challenging our education, influencing our teams and managers, and doing more comprehensive user research are all ways to make progress. Although change is uncomfortable and the path to high performance can be painful, it is possible through collaboration and creativity. 

Lastly, as future exceptional engineers, we should focus first on the users most impacted by bias and discrimination. Together, we can work to accelerate progress by focusing on Continuous Improvement and owning our failures. Becoming an engineer is an involved and continual process. The goal is to make changes that push humanity forward without further disenfranchising the disadvantaged. As future exceptional engineers, we have faith that we can prevent future failures in the system.

## Conclusion

Developing software, and developing a software organization, is a team effort. As a software organization scales, it must respond and adequately design for its user base, which in the interconnected world of computing today involves everyone, locally and around the world. More effort must be made to make both the development teams that design software and the products that they produce reflect the values of such a diverse and encompassing set of users. And, if an engineering organization wants to scale, it cannot ignore underrepresented groups; not only do such engineers from these groups augment the organization itself, they provide unique and necessary perspectives for the design and implementation of software that is truly useful to the world at large. 

## TL;DRs 

• Bias is the default. 

• Diversity is necessary to design properly for a comprehensive user base. 

• Inclusivity is critical not just to improving the hiring pipeline for underrepresented groups, but to providing a truly supportive work environment for all people. 

• Product velocity must be evaluated against providing a product that is truly useful to all users. It’s better to slow down than to release a product that might cause harm to some users.
