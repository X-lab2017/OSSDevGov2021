Compilation errors and tests also typically refer back to a code location (e.g., test X in file at line). These can be linkified even for unsubmitted code given that most development happens in specific cloud-visible workspaces that are accessible and searchable by Code Search.

Finally, codelabs and other documentation refer to APIs, examples, and implementations. Such links can be search queries referencing a specific class or function, which remain valid when the file structure changes. For code snippets, the most recent implementation at head can easily be embedded into a documentation page, as demonstrated in Figure 17-4, without the need to pollute the source file with additional documentation markers.

### API Exposure
Code Search exposes its search, cross-reference, and syntax highlighting APIs to tools, so tool developers can bring those capabilities into their tools without needing to reimplement them. Further, plug-ins have been written to provide search and cross-references to editors and IDEs such as vim, emacs, and IntelliJ. These plug-ins restore some of the power lost due to being unable to locally index the codebase, and give back some developer productivity.

## Impact of Scale on Design
In the previous section, we looked at various aspects of the Code Search UI and why it’s worthwhile having a separate tool for browsing code. In the following sections, we look a bit behind the scenes of the implementation. We first discuss the primary challenge—scaling—and then some of the ways the large scale complicates making a good product for searching and browsing code. After that, we detail how we addressed some of those challenges, and what trade-offs were made when building Code Search.
The biggest scaling challenge for searching code is the corpus size. For a small repository of a couple megabytes, a brute-force search with grep search will do. When hundreds of megabytes need to be searched, a simple local index can speed up search by an order of magnitude or more. When gigabytes or terabytes of source code need to be searched, a cloud-hosted solution with multiple machines can keep search times reasonable. The utility of a central solution increases with the number of developers using it and the size of the code space.

### Search Query Latency

Although we take as a given that a fast and responsive UI is better for the user, low latency doesn’t come for free. To justify the effort, one can weigh it against the saved engineering time across all users. Within Google, we process much more than one million search queries from developers within Code Search per day. For one million queries, an increase of just one second per search request corresponds to about 35 idle full-time engineers every day. In contrast, the search backend can be built and maintained with roughly a tenth of these engineers. This means that with about 100,000 queries per day (corresponding to less than 5,000 developers), just the one-second latency argument is something of a break-even point.
In reality, the productivity loss doesn’t simply increase linearly with latency. A UI is considered responsive if latencies are below 200 ms. But after just one second, the developer’s attention often begins to drift. If another 10 seconds pass, the developer is likely to switch context completely, which is generally recognized to have high productivity costs. The best way to keep a developer in the productive “flow” state is by targeting sub–200 ms end-to-end latency for all frequent operations and investing in the corresponding backends.


A large number of Code Search queries are performed in order to navigate the codebase. Ideally, the “next” file is only a click away (e.g., for included files, or symbol definitions), but for general navigation, instead of using the classical file tree, it can be much faster to simply search for the desired file or symbol, ideally without needing to fully specify it, and suggestions are provided for partial text. This becomes increasingly true as the codebase (and file tree) grows.

Normal navigation to a specific file in another folder or project requires several user interactions. With search, just a couple of keystrokes can be sufficient to get to the relevant file. To make search this effective, additional information about the search context (e.g., the currently viewed file) can be provided to the search backend. The context can restrict the search to files of a specific project, or influence ranking by preferring files that are in proximity to other files or directories. In the Code Search UI, the user can predefine multiple contexts and quickly switch between them as needed. In editors, the open or edited files are implicitly used as context to prioritize search results in their proximity.

One could consider the power of the search query language (e.g., specifying files, using regular expressions) as another criteria; we discuss this in the trade-offs section a little later in the chapter.

### Index Latency
Most of the time, developers won’t notice when indices are out of date. They only care about a small subset of code, and even for that they generally won’t know whether there is more recent code. However, for the cases in which they wrote or reviewed the corresponding change, being out of sync can cause a lot of confusion. It tends not to matter whether the change was a small fix, a refactoring, or a completely new piece of code—developers simply expect a consistent view, such as they experience in their IDE for a small project.


When writing code, instant indexing of modified code is expected. When new files, functions, or classes are added, not being able to find them is frustrating and breaks the normal workflow for developers used to perfect cross-referencing. Another example are search-and-replace–based refactorings. It is not only more convenient when the removed code immediately disappears from the search results, but it is also essential that subsequent refactorings take the new state into account. When working with a centralized VCS, a developer might need instant indexing for submitted code if the previous change is no longer part of the locally modified file set.


Conversely, sometimes it’s useful to be able to go back in time to a previous snapshot of the code; in other words, a release. During an incident, a discrepancy between the index and the running code can be especially problematic because it can hide real causes or introduce irrelevant distractions. This is a problem for cross-references because the current technology for building an index at Google’s scale simply takes hours, and the complexity means that only one “version” of the index is kept. Although some patching can be done to align new code with an old index, this is still an issue to be solved.

## Google’s Implementation
Google’s particular implementation of Code Search is tailored to the unique characteristics of its codebase, and the previous section outlined our design constraints for creating a robust and responsive index. The following section outlines how the Code Search team implemented and released its tool to Google developers.

### Search Index
Google’s codebase is a special challenge for Code Search due to its sheer size. In the early days, a trigram-based approach was taken. Russ Cox subsequently open sourced a simplified version. Currently, Code Search indexes about 1.5 TB of content and processes about 200 queries per second with a median server-side search latency of less than 50 ms and a median indexing latency (time between code commit and visibility in the index) of less than 10 seconds.

Let’s roughly estimate the resource requirements to achieve this performance with a grep -based brute-force solution. The RE2 library we use for regular expression matching processes about 100 MB/sec for data in RAM. Given a time window of 50 ms, 300,000 cores would be needed to crunch through the 1.5 TB of data. Because in most cases simple substring searches are sufficient, one could replace the regular expression matching with a special substring search that can process about 1 GB/sec under certain conditions, reducing the number of cores by 10 times. So far, we have looked at just the resource requirements for processing a single query within 50 ms. If we’re getting 200 requests per second, 10 of those will be simultaneously active in that 50 ms window, bringing us back to 300,000 cores just for substring search.

Although this estimate ignores that the search can stop once a certain number of results are found or that file restrictions can be evaluated much more effectively than content searches, it doesn’t take communication overhead, ranking, or the fan out to tens of thousands of machines into account either. But it shows quite well the scale involved and why Google’s Code Search team continuously invests into improving indexing. Over the years, our index changed from the original trigram-based solution, through a custom suffix array–based solution, to the current sparse n-gram solution. This latest solution is more than 500 times more efficient than the brute-force solution while being capable of also answering regular expression searches at blazing speed.

One reason we moved from a suffix array–based solution to a token-based n-gram solution was to take advantage of Google’s primary indexing and search stack. With a suffix array–based solution, building and distributing the custom indices becomes a challenge in and of itself. By utilizing “standard” technology, we benefit from all the advances in reverse index construction, encoding, and serving made by the core search team. Instant indexing is another feature that exists in standard search stacks, and by itself is a big challenge when solving it at scale.

Relying on standard technology is a trade-off between implementation simplicity and performance. Even though Google’s Code Search implementation is based on standard reverse indices, the actual retrieval, matching, and scoring are highly customized and optimized. Some of the more advanced Code Search features wouldn’t be possible otherwise. To index the history of file revisions, we came up with a custom compression scheme in which indexing the full history increased the resource consumption by a factor of just 2.5.

In the early days, Code Search served all data from memory. With the growing index size, we moved the inverted index to flash. Although flash storage is at least an order of magnitude cheaper than memory, its access latency is at least two orders of magnitude higher. So, indices that work well in memory might not be suitable when served from flash. For instance, the original trigram index requires fetching not only a large number of reverse indices from flash, but also quite large ones. With n-gram schemes, both the number of inverse indices and their size can be reduced at the expense of a larger index.

To support local workspaces (which have a small delta from the global repository), we have multiple machines doing simple brute-force searches. The workspace data is loaded on the first request and then kept in sync by listening for file changes. When we run out of memory, we remove the least recent workspace from the machines. The unchanged documents are searched with our history index. Therefore, the search is implicitly restricted to the repository state to which the workspace is synced.


### Ranking
For a very small codebase, ranking doesn’t provide much benefit, because there aren’t many results anyway. But the larger the codebase becomes, the more results will be found and the more important ranking becomes. In Google’s codebase, any short substring will occur thousands, if not millions, of times. Without ranking, the user either must check all of those results in order to find the correct one, or must refine the query further until the result set is reduced to just a handful of files. Both options waste the developer’s time.

Ranking typically starts with a scoring function, which maps a set of features of each file (“signals”) to some number: the higher the score, the better the result. The goal of the search is then to find the top N results as efficiently as possible. Typically, one distinguishes between two types of signals: those that depend only on the document (“query independent”) and those that depend on the search query and how it matches the document (“query dependent”). The filename length or the programming language of a file would be examples of query independent signals, whereas whether a match is a function definition or a string literal is a query dependent signal.

#### Query independent signals
Some of the most important query independent signals are the number of file views and the amount of references to a file. File views are important because they indicate which files developers consider important and are therefore more likely to want to find. For instance, utility functions in base libraries have a high view count. It doesn’t matter whether the library is already stable and isn’t changed anymore or whether the library is being actively developed. The biggest downside of this signal is the feedback loop it creates. By scoring frequently viewed documents higher, the chance increases that developers will look at them and decreases the chance of other documents to make it into the top N. This problem is known as exploitation versus exploration, for which various solutions exist (e.g., advanced A/B search experiments or curation of training data). In practice, it doesn’t seem harmful to somewhat over-show high-scoring items: they are simply ignored when irrelevant and taken if a generic example is needed. However, it is a problem for new files, which don’t yet have enough information for a good signal. 
We also use the number of references to a file, which parallels the original page rank algorithm, by replacing web links as references with the various kinds of “include/import” statements present in most languages. We can extend the concept up to build dependencies (library/module level references) and down to functions and classes. This global relevance is often referred to as the document’s “priority.”

When using references for ranking, one must be aware of two challenges. First, you must be able to extract reference information reliably. In the early days, Google’s Code Search extracted include/import statements with simple regular expressions and then applied heuristics to convert them into full file paths. With the growing complexity of a codebase, such heuristics became error prone and challenging to maintain. Internally, we replaced this part with correct information from the Kythe graph.

Large-scale refactorings, such as open sourcing core libraries, present a second challenge. Such changes don’t happen atomically in a single code update; rather, they need to be rolled out in multiple stages. Typically, indirections are introduced, hiding, for example, the move of files from usages. These kinds of indirections reduce the page rank of moved files and make it more difficult for developers to discover the new location. Additionally, file views usually become lost when files are moved, making the situation even worse. Because such global restructurings of the codebase are comparatively rare (most interfaces move rarely), the simplest solution is to manually boost files during such transition periods. (Or wait until the migration completes and for the natural processes to up-rank the file in its new location.)

#### Query dependent signals
Query independent signals can be computed offline, so computational cost isn’t a major concern, although it can be high. For example, for the “page” rank, the signal depends on the whole corpus and requires a MapReduce-like batch processing to calculate. Query dependent signals, which must be calculated for each query, should be cheap to compute. This means that they are restricted to the query and information quickly accessible from the index. 

Unlike web search, we don’t just match on tokens. However, if there are clean token matches (that is, the search term matches with content with some form of breaks, such as whitespace, around it), a further boost is applied and case sensitivity is considered. This means, for example, a search for “Point” will score higher against "Point *p” than against “appointed to the council.”

For convenience, a default search matches filename and qualified symbols 14 in addition to the actual file content. A user can specify the particular kind of match, but they don’t need to. The scoring boosts symbol and filename matches over normal content matches to reflect the inferred intent of the developer.
